# Developer Guide

This guide details the process of contributing to the FLEXI source code and is intended as both an introduction for new developers
and a reference for those with more experience. The sections proceed through the development process as topics are encountered from a newcomers point of view.

For **New Developers**, it is recommended that you read at least the [Git Workflow](#01_gitworkflow) and [Style Guide](#02_styleguide) sections before attempting to write any code. These sections contain all the agreed development and programming conventions used by all other FLEXI developers. If you intend your code to someday be included in the `master` version of FLEXI, it must to adhere to these conventions.
The sections on [Data Structures](#03_datastructures) and [Useful Functions](#04_usefulfunctions) are intended only as a reference. If you ever find yourself wondering where to find data or a function you need, those sections should be your first destination.
The remaining sections cover specialized topics relevant later in the development process and can be read or referenced as needed.
